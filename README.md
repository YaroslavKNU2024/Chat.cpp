To run a program, open a server solution, and start the application. Afterwards, start a client program. 
If the connection is successful, you could run the program in a form of:

name of variable; type; value - in order to create / rewrite a variable.
Ex.: i; int; 10
//i = 10 will be created.
To print a variable that already exists, just type in its name
